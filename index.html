            <h2>Future of Bee Sting Allergy Treatment</h2>
            <p>
                Omazulib, a new biologic treatment, works by blocking the binding of IgE (Immunoglobulin E) to its receptors on immune cells. By preventing this crucial interaction, Omazulib essentially “interrupts” the allergic reaction at its source. With IgE unable to bind and activate these cells, the immune system’s mechanism of action offers a more targeted and efficient way to prevent venom-induced allergic responses, without the need for frequent venom exposure required in traditional immunotherapy. By controlling the IgE-driven pathway, Omazulib represents a better future for precision allergy treatment, focused on solving the root cause rather than just managing symptoms.
